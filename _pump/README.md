## Bomb node

There are a couple pumps working together to move the water from well to the big water storage placed on the high tower:
- The first stage is powered by a thin-vertical-bomb inside the well, located eighty meters down. It pushes water to an intermediary tank at surface.
- A second and powerful bomb is responsible to take the water from the intermediary tank at surface and fill the big water storage placed on the high tower.

The main specifications and features for the `bomb node` are listed below.

### Raspberry Pi Zero W

Due to low cost with powerful ARM11 core processor and built in wireless LAN, the `Pi Zero W` was selected to power the `tank node`. Its main features are:

- 1Ghz, Broadcom BCM 2835 single-core processor
- 512 MB of RAM
- 1 micro USB port for power supply
- Compatible with existing HATs
- Composite video and reset headers
- CSI Camera Connector
- 40-pin GPIO connector (same pinout as A+/B+/2B)
- On-board Wireless LAN â€“ 2.4 GHz 802.11 b/g/n (BCM43438)
- On-board Bluetooth 4.1 + HS Low-energy (BLE) (BCM43438)

### Sensors (TODO)

For this project, the following sensors were selected:

- **Water level:** [VL53L1X](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html) - ToF (time of flight) sensor.
- **Temperature:** [HTU21D](https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/HTU21DF.PDF) - Digital Relative Humidity sensor with Temperature output.
- **Humidity:** [HTU21D](https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/HTU21DF.PDF) - Digital Relative Humidity sensor with Temperature output.
- **Luminance:** [BH1750](https://www.mouser.com/ds/2/348/bh1750fvi-e-186247.pdf)  - Digital 16bit Serial Output Type Ambient Light Sensor.

#### Water level
The water level sensor VL53L1X is installed inside the tank, as seen below, at the top. Then, the sensor measurement reflects the distance from the top of the tank to the water surface. This measurement allows calculating the water level and consequently the volume stored in the tank.

The STMicroelectronics VL53L1X "time of flight sensor" is equipped with an invisible laser to measure distances with millimeter resolution. Please check the [full specs on the product page](https://www.st.com/en/imaging-and-photonics-solutions/vl53l1x.html) and the available [breakout](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14722) shown below.

#### Temperature, humidity and luminance

Suppose a tank node equipped with a single set of these sensors. They may be installed in three positions:

- **Outside tank:** sensors outside the tank would measure environmental conditions in the tank area.
- **Inside tank, outside node:** these sensors would measure the internal tank conditions.
- **Inside tank, inside node:** these sensors would evaluate the internal conditions of the node itself.

The tank node prototype, shown upside down in the photo, has a VL53L1X sensor pointing down towards water direction. The Pi Zero W is tied to an [Anavi Infrared pHat](https://www.crowdsupply.com/anavi-technology/infrared-phat) with I2C connections for the three sensors. The temperature, humidity and luminance sensors are installed inside the node, in order to evaluate internal prototype conditions. It is expected that internal temperature and humidity changes with CPU utilization, for example.

The luminance sensor actually measures light conditions inside the tank, since node prototype has a transparent case. Since VL53L1X performance may vary with light interference, an "open hatch" alarm may be created, in case light is detected inside the water tank. Also, open water tanks are a *very bad idea*, due to mosquito proliferation!

## Install Hass.io

The `Pi Zero W` is supposed to be installed with following software:

- **Linux Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.1 (stretch)**. [Lite version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), the minimal image based on Debian Stretch. Generate the Micro SD Card with [Etcher](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-sd-etcher/), for example, and boot the RPI.
- If you need the configuration program **raspi-config**, it is already available at Stretch Lite version.
- You should also install **Git**, used to clone the IoT.Hass.farm repository.

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Next step is installing Hass.io, easy with Dale Higgs [hassio-installer](https://github.com/josemotta/hassio-installer). Run the script below to install all requirements, including the latest Docker version that works fine with `Pi Zero W`. Then, Hass.io is finally installed.

    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josemotta/hassio-installer/master/setup-hassio-rpi0w.sh | bash -s

You should have now the latest version of Homeassistant running. You can start the frontend, using a browser, and enter the IP address of prototype followed by port 8123.

## Clone the repo

The next step will replace the Homeassistant config directory with IoT.Hass.Farm (or your customized fork).

- Stop Homeassistant, using Hass.io developer tools, click `Services` and select `homeassistant.stop`;
- Clear the Homeassistant configuration located at `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant`;
- Clone the IoT.Hass.Farm repository inside this folder;
- Run `./set-config.sh tank` script to initialize configuration folder;
- Set your secrets file;
- And finally reboot.

After you stop Homeassistant, replacement is done with the following commands, as shown below:

```
$ cd /usr/share/hassio/homeassistant
$ sudo rm -rf ./*
$ sudo rm -rf ./.*

$ sudo git clone https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Hass.Farm.git .

$ sudo mv secrets-dummy.yaml secrets.yaml
$ sudo reboot
```

After the boot you can check packages being dynamically loaded at `config/deps` folder, as shown below. You may have to reboot again to start using VL53L1X, after package is loaded.

Open the browser and enter the IP address of prototype followed by port 8123 to start the user interface. In the first use an user id and password will be required to create the admin account.

The MQTT streaming generated at each tank node publishes all sensor data that should be monitored.  This system may be easily scaled for many tanks and is smart enough to handle simple decisions.
