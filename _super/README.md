## Supervisor node

The `tank nodes` themselves are not enough to calculate the total water in the system, since they only handle local information about each tank. As shown in the diagram below, a second level is created for a `supervisor node` that collects information from a group of tanks.

## Install Hass.io

The Raspberry Pi 3B was used at the supervisor node since further processing is expected in the near future. For this project, in order to make comparisons with tank data, the supervisor also has sensors to collect the room temperature, humidity, and luminance.

The supervisor node gather information about a group of tanks, using an MQTT server that receive messages from all tanks under its supervision. For this project, the supervisor  node should collect sensors measurements about water level, temperature, humidity and luminance from each tank. Then, the MQTT streams generated by a group of tanks are published to their  respective supervisor.

The Pi 3B is supposed to be installed with following software:

- **Linux Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.1 (stretch)**. [Lite version](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), the minimal image based on Debian Stretch. Generate the Micro SD Card with [Etcher](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/pi-sd-etcher/), for example, and boot the RPI.
- If you need the configuration program **raspi-config**, it is already available at Stretch Lite version.
- You should also install **Git**, used to clone the IoT.Hass.farm repository.

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```

Next step is installing Hass.io, easy with Dale Higgs [hassio-installer](https://github.com/josemotta/hassio-installer). Run the script below to install all requirements, including the latest Docker version. Then, Hass.io is finally installed for Raspberry Pi 3B.

    curl -sL https://github.com/josemotta/hassio-installer/blob/master/hassio_rpi3bp | bash -s

You should have now the latest version of Homeassistant running. You can start the frontend, using a browser, and enter the IP address of prototype followed by port 8123.

To clone the repo, just repeat same [procedure used at tank node](https://github.com/josemotta/IoT.Hass.Farm/blob/master/_tank/README.md#clone-the-repo) and replace the Homeassistant config directory with IoT.Hass.Farm (or your customized fork). The only difference is that now `set-config.sh` parameter should initialize the supervisor node:

- Stop Homeassistant, using Hass.io developer tools, click `Services` and select `homeassistant.stop`;
- Clear the Homeassistant configuration located at `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant`;
- Clone the IoT.Hass.Farm repository inside this folder;
- Run `./set-config.sh super` script to initialize configuration folder;
- Set your secrets file;
- And finally reboot.

As you can notice, there are many common configuration files to tank and supervisor nodes.

### Publish tank data

The following parameters are required at Homeassistant configuration to publish and send tank data to its supervisor:

- The supervisor network address, defined by the MQTT `mqtt broker`.
- The data entities to be monitored, configured at `mqtt_statestream`.

Please see details below, extracted from the `configuration.yaml` file from the tank node:

	...

	# MQTT Broker (aka Mosquitto)
	mqtt:
	  broker: !secret mqtt_broker
	  client_id: slave
	  port: !secret mqtt_port
	  keepalive: 60
	  username: !secret mqtt_username
	  password: !secret mqtt_password
	
	mqtt_statestream:
	  base_topic: homeassistant
	  publish_attributes: true
	  publish_timestamps: true
	  include:
	    entities:
	      - sensor.tank_water_level
	      - sensor.tank_vl53l1x
	      - sensor.tank_bh1750
	      - sensor.tank_htu21d_humidity
	      - sensor.tank_htu21d_temperature
	...


### MQTT data flow

A Homeassistant automation guarantee that entities are properly recreated at supervisor node, as soon as the MQTT server receives messages from tanks. The  automation, edited for clarity below, recreates the corresponding entity at the supervisor node.

	- id: '1552680266680'
	  alias: mqtt_config_entity_creator_sensor
	  trigger:
	  - platform: mqtt
	    topic: homeassistant/sensor/#
	  condition:
	  - condition: template
	    value_template: "{{ trigger.topic.split('/')[3] == 'unit_of_measurement' }}"
	  action:
	  - service: mqtt.publish
	    data_template:
	      topic: "homeassistant/sensor/{{ trigger.topic.split('/')[2] }}/config"
	      payload: "{\"name\": \"{{ trigger.topic.split('/')[2]| replace('_', ' ') | title }}\",
	               \"unit_of_measurement\": \"{{ trigger.payload_json }}\",
                   \"state_topic\": \"homeassistant/sensor/{{ trigger.topic.split('/')[2] }}/state\"}"
	      retain: true

The MQTT.fx Client shows below the live data published at supervisor node.

### User Interface

An user interface was created at the tank supervisor, showing information from its tanks. This system may be easily scaled for many tanks and is smart enough to handle simple decisions. The following panel example shows data collected from a single tank with the ToF sensor located in front of a fixed and static wall, in order to evaluate the sensor repeatability. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/hJGcEWW.jpg)

An extra calculation is the `delta temperature`, calculated for each tank, based on the difference between data collected from it and the "normal" temperature registered by supervisor sensors. An alarm for unexpected temperature in the tank may be raised, demonstrating the typical behavior from higher levels nodes in the SCADA architecture. The experiment also shows below some history data, collected with normal daylight.

As you can notice, at night there is no luminance interference and ToF technology has a better precision (less variance) on measurements results. You can also verify the difference between tank and supervisor sensors shown in this history panel.
